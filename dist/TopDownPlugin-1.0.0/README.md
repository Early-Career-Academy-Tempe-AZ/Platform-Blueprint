The Top-Down Blueprint is an easy to use blueprint for Kiwi.js that you can include to rapidly develop a top-down Kiwi game.

A top-down game has a game perspective that views the action from above, commonly at a fixed position and/or rotation. The player moves four directions to navigate around the game area.

This Blueprint allows users to rapidly develop a top-down game. This repository is in active development and should be updated almost daily until we release an official version.

HTML5 Platform Game Blueprint
================================

A platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms, over obstacles, or both to advance the game. These challenges are known as jumping puzzles or freerunning. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps.

This Blueprint allows users to rapidly develop a basic platforming game. This repository is in active development and should be updated almost daily until we release an official version. 

##Features

* Tile map Creation (Tiled support)

##Contribute 

If you discover a bug or find yourself just wanting to jump on in please file an issue and get stuck in. We're a friedly bunch and hope people find themselves wanting to get involved.
